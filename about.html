                  <p>Till now, I have tried a few things in web development. But nothing kept me going in the long run.
                    I have really liked a few things, but I couldn't continue doing them and explore more.
                    I guess this is due to lack of systematic guidance. So I want to properly explore and understand several aspects of 
                    software development and find my true interests.

                  <div>
                    <p>My journey till now with Explorin has been really wonderful. I have really enjoyed and liked all the 
                        things which I have done here; be it learning from resources, understanding new concepts, doing tasks, 
                        interacting with all the mentors, industrial experts and all the explorers. Each day I am getting to learn 
                        something new. So, I am really looking forward to the program and wish to learn and explore more.
